# Scroll Animation

This is a scroll animation: when you start to scroll down new content blocks come in, alternating in direction, once from the left, once from the right.

I used CSS transitions for this project. In the JavaScript it is important to specify where the trigger point is for the next box to come in. I used the method getBoundingClientRect() and innerHeight to do so.

This is the 6th project from Brad Traversy's Udemy Course "50 Projects in 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript".
